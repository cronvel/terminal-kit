Compatibility WARNING:
Fix ScreenBuffer, so default fg/bg colors are... well... the default. (instead of black background)
This behavior was a bug, but it may change existing app, especially when the terminal 'default' background color
is different from the color register 0, and the app forgot to initialize the screenBuffer with
a background color (many terminals use color 0 or 7 as the default for background, some like Gnome-Terminal have a special
color for that).
So before 1.25, when unspecified, the background color was 'black' (color register 0, it was a bug),
starting from 1.25, when unspecified, the background color is 'default' (the terminal default).

v1.0.5
------

24 bits colors are back:
A couple of month ago (around nov 2016 and feb 2017), major terminals (gnome-terminal, Konsole, iTerm, ...)
changed the behavior of the $COLORTERM environment variable (without much advertising, BTW...),
and that totally messed up terminal detection.

Instead of containing the terminal identifier, now it contains "truecolor" if the terminal supports true-color.
Failing to find a terminal named "truecolor", Terminal-kit was falling back to "xterm".

I noticed that just now. -_-'
Fixed.

v0.17.0
-------

New: .inputField() now has an 'area' mode (standard mode is now known as 'inline' mode) that use ScreenBuffer and TextBuffer
for its rendering, allowing confined text-area-like inputs. This is still a work in progress and many features of the 'inline' mode

-------

.inputField(): fixed some issues with BACKSPACE when at the first column, and history UP and DOWN at the bottom line.

-------

v0.14.0
-------

.singleLineMenu(): support for TAB and SHIFT_TAB keys that cycle forward and backward.
.inputField(): same when in the auto-complete menu (since it uses .singleLineMenu() behind the scene)


v0.13.16
--------

Improvement of cleanup code on exit.
Issue #3 is fixed again (regression somewhere between 0.13.6 and 0.13.14).


v0.13.15
--------

Documentation: 
* nice animated gif for each example of: progressBar, inputField, singleLineMenu, yesOrNo
* fixes in the examples
* .processExit() is now documentated, thus under SemVer

v0.12.3
-------

Bugfix: timeout detection for .getColor() and .getCursorLocation(), .inputField() is changed accordingly (and cleaned up)


v0.12.2
-------

Documentation improvements.


v0.12.1
-------

.singleLineMenu() callback's 'response' argument has 2 new properties: 'x' and 'y', the coordinates of the selected item.


v0.12.0
-------

Backward compatibility broken: .singleLineMenu()'s callback is now:
* callback( error , response ), where:
	* error `mixed` truthy if an underlying error occurs
	* response `Object` where
		* selectedIndex `number` the user-selected menu item index
		* selectedText `string` the user-selected menu item text
		* unexpectedKey `string` when 'exitOnUnexpectedKey' option is set and an unexpected key is pressed, this contains
		  the key that produced the exit

Using named parameters for the callback is a more reliable and flexible API that will avoid breakage in the future,
when feature will be added.


v0.11.3
-------

* .inputField(): custom auto-completer can be asynchronous now, see the doc.

* Documentation: static method termkit.autoComplete() is now documented.

  new next/previous page hint feature

* .inputField() option 'menuOption' has moved to/mixed with 'autoCompleteMenu'


v0.10.9
-------

.inputField() now has the option 'autoCompleteMenu' to use in conjunction with 'autoComplete', it displays a single line menu
displaying all the completion candidate, when more than one is possible.


v0.10.8
-------

New method: .singleLineMenu(), which creates a simple menu, the user can select item with arrow keys and RETURN/ENTER.


v0.10.7
-------

Documentation on .createTerminal() is now available.


v0.10.6
-------

Stupid Gnome-terminal do not set COLORTERM environment variable anymore... this is a workaround to detect it.


v0.10.5
-------

Gnome-terminal now supports 24bits colors, so the support for it has been added.


v0.10.4
-------

.inputField() returned value, the inputControler, is now an event emitter (it emits 'ready'), and it features a 'redraw()' method.


v0.10.3
-------

.inputField() now supports an 'autoComplete' option, see the doc


v0.10.2
-------

.inputField() now supports an 'history' option, so UP and DOWN keys move up and down in the history


v0.10.1
-------

.inputField() returns more way to control it:
	* getPosition(): return an object containing 'x' and 'y' properties, the coordinates where the input field starts
	* hide(): hide the input field, it still records keystrokes
	* show(): show the input field again
	* rebase(): rebase the input field to the current cursor position (it does NOT erase the previous one,
	  use hide() before, see the doc)


v0.10.0
-------

.inputField() now returns an object featuring some functions to control things during the input process:
	* abort(): abort the input process and do not even call the inputField()'s callback
	* stop(): stop the input process now, call the inputField()'s callback (same behaviour than a regular 'ENTER' key pressed)
	* getInput(): get the current input string


v0.9.14
-------

Added a link to the tutorials at blog.soulserv.net/tag/terminal.


v0.9.13
-------

Upgraded dependencies.


v0.9.11 - v0.9.12
-----------------

.noFormat() is now documented (thus under the SemVer contract).


v0.9.10
-------

Upgraded to string-kit@0.1.5.


v0.9.9
------

Just a small addition to the documentation: require() are added in most example (user's feedback).


v0.9.8
------

Upgraded dependencies.


v0.9.2 - v0.9.7
---------------

Package description & README.md that better fit the new npmjs.org site.


v0.9.1
-------

Removing tools/sprite-editor.js: the editor has now its own package: 'leeted'.
The demo located in demo/spaceship.js works again (sprites have been converted to file format V2).
Some performance optimization have greatly improved CPU usage.


v0.9.0
-------

File format has changed for ScreenBuffer.loadSync() and screenBuffer.saveSync().
This is now the format version 2.
File of format version 1 can still be loaded/saved using ScreenBuffer.loadSyncV1() and screenBuffer.saveSyncV1().
This file format is more flexible, so improvement to the lib can be achieved without changing the file format each time.


v0.8.0
-------

The Rect class has moved from termkit.ScreenBuffer.Rect to termkit.Rect
The 'key' event callback's argument #2 (data) now contains a 'isCharacter' property, true for printable, false for control
screenBuffer.clear() -> screenBuffer.fill()


v0.7.1
-------

Sprite editor now support the mouse.


v0.7.0
-------

ScreenBuffer now use Big Endian: there is no performance drop on Little Endian system and the code is less error prone.


v0.6.14
-------

ScreenBuffer .put() now support the 'wrap' option, bypassing the default 'wrap' value of the current screenBuffer.


v0.6.13
-------

ScreenBuffer .put() now support writing in any of the 4 directions.
The sprite editor can set the writing direction.


v0.6.12
-------

ScreenBuffer blending: style transparency bugfix.
Improvement of the sprite editor (new features: fill colors/style, put only attributes).
Improvement of the demo graphics.


v0.6.11
-------

Improvement of the sprite editor (editor's background character is not customizable).


v0.6.10
-------

Now it is possible to resize a ScreenBuffer.
Improvement of the sprite editor (sprite resizing, editor's background colors are customizable).


v0.6.9
------

Many type of transparencies: foreground color, background color, style & character.
New: a sprite editor, located in demo/sprite-editor.js.


v0.6.8
------

Refactoring, so the tile-variant & the wrap-variant of blitter are now available for the terminal blitter.


v0.6.7
------

The 'tile' blitter is now faster and cleaner.
Some bugfix on buffer creation (size should be integer, not float).


v0.6.6
------

The buffer to buffer blitter now support the 'tile' option.


v0.6.5
------

The buffer to buffer blitter now support the 'wrap' option.


v0.6.2 - v0.6.4
---------------

Improved terminal's blitter.


v0.6.1
------

ScreenBuffer refactoring.


v0.6.0
------

Major change in the module.exports tree: the backward compatibility is broken, but it can be easily fixed.
Just replace:

var term = require( 'terminal-kit' ) ;

... by:

var term = require( 'terminal-kit' ).terminal ;

Now, that is when the .terminal property is accessed for the first time that a terminal is guessed.

This make the code cleaner and remove any trouble when circular require() occurs: the module does not perform
anything until an userland code request so.


v0.5.17
-------

Spaceship demo: added a spaceship moving with the arrow keys.


v0.5.16
-------

Spaceship demo: scrolling space.
